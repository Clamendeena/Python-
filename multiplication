#python code for multiplication with inputs

a=10
b=20
c=a*b
print(c)

#O/P: 
#200

#Explanation
#10 value is stored in "a"
#20 value is stored in "b"
#"c" variable contains the mul of a and b
#prints the output

#python code for multiplication with user given inputs

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a*b
print(c)

#O/P: 
#4
#4
#16

#Explanation
#user given integer value is stored in "a"
#user given integer value is stored in "b"
#"c" variable contains the mul of a and b
#prints the output
